Principle Component Analysis of normalized gene expression data

This project applies principle component analysis (PCA) to a normalized RNA-seq data set with 801 samples and 20,531 features corresponding to genes of the human genome.  After finding an optimal number of clusters, an unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm was applied to the data, and cluster labels were compared to cancer labels. 

Data set used was from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq.
